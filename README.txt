APPLICATION INFORMATION
------------------------
TITLE: C195 Scheduling Application
PURPOSE: This application's main use is to allow users to schedule appointments for customers while also having to the ability to add, update, and delete customers and appointments. Reports can also be generated that give the user some insight into the appointments and customers.


REPORT INFORMATION
------------------------
I chose as my third report to display each contact and the number of appointments each contact has. I thought this would be useful to display to ensure each contact doesn't have too many or too few appointments and to keep from having to manually count each contact appointment.


RUNNING THE PROGRAM
------------------------
1.) Start the application.
2.) Enter valid login information into the text fields.
3.) Once logged in, the user is brought to the main menu where all appointments and customers can be seen.
4.) The buttons to the right of the table allow the user to add, delete, or update customers and appointments.
5.) In order to update or select, an appointment or customer has to be selected first from the either table. 
6.) To add a customer or appointment, click the add button and that should load the new add menu  where the user can enter the information needed.
7.) To view reports, click on the button at the bottom right.
8.) To change the appointment to current week or current month, please select one of the radio buttons above the appointments table.
9.) To logout, please go to the main menu and click the logout button at the bottom right.
